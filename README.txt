An implementation of Dung's argumentation frameworks, an abstract argumentation 
model used to either directly represent conflicting information, or used as
a translation target for more complex (structured) argumentation models. 
For an introduction to Dung's frameworks see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_framework 
and Dung's paper from 1995: "On the acceptability of arguments and its fundamental role
in nonmonotonic reasoning, logic programming, and n-person games", Artificial Intelligence 77: 321-357.
For the paper accompanying this library see "Towards a framework for the implementation and verification 
of translations between argumentation models" available at http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~bmv/Dung/.
