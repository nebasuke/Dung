1.0.0.1 => 1.1
==============
This package version is now compatible with the command-line application for 
the ICCMA competition. See: https://github.com/nebasuke/DungICCMA and the
competition website: http://argumentationcompetition.org/2015/index.html

This package has again been significantly extended and now includes:

* Strict version of the grounded fixpoint semantics.

* Definitions of what it means to be a preferred and stable extension.

* Naive implementations of complete, preferred and stable semantics using 
  the characteristic function. The fixpoint definitions are actually FASTER
  than the fancy algorithm implementation. 
  
* Included the fast implementations of intersect, nub and (\\) by Niklas 
  Hambuechen. 
  
* Added some clarifying text for the "complete" labelling.


1.0 => 1.0.0.1
==============
* Fixed the record declaration in Main.hs.

* Added an example file.

0.9 => 1.0
=============
This package version is now compatible with the translation package CarneadesIntoDung. 
See http://hackage.haskell.org/package/CarneadesIntoDung/

This package has furthermore been significantly extended and now includes:

* Preferred, stable and semi-stable semantics along with all definitions from
   Caminada's paper "An Algorithm for Computing Semi-Stable Semantics".

* An Input module, allowing files in standard CEGARTIX/PrefSat format to be parsed.

* An Output module, allowing AFs in this package to be outputted in standard
  CEGARTIX/PrefSat format.

* A main executable, allowing input files to be read, argumentation frameworks
  to be outputted and evaluated.
